# Rules of the Game:

## Set-Up:
### Determine the number of players.
CPWP can be played with 3-8 players. Playing with actual cards and actual people, 6 seems to be a good number.

### Shuffle all the cards
**All?**
  * if 3-4 players, one deck
  * if 5-8 players, two decks

**Deck?** standard deck of 52 playing cards; 54 if playing a JOKER Variation

**Cards?** 4 suits, A-K

### Deal all the cards
**Deal?** evenly distribute them to each player
	- Extra cards are dealt out as normal; last (few) player(s) may start with one less card than other players.  

## PLAY:
### The player with the 7 of Diamonds (7D) card goes first
**First?** turn-based

**7D?** -- not any D, not any 7

### The player places a viable card on the board
**Viable card?**
  * any 7
  * the same suit as a 7(s) used to originate a row, and
    * it is the card nearest in ascending value to 7 that has not been played yet, or 			
    * it is the card nearest in descending value to 7 that has not been played yet
  * Ace is low

**Places?**
  * Hearts and Diamonds are played on separate rows
  * if one deck (3-4 players)
    * Clubs and Spades suits are played on one row
  * if two decks (5–8 players)
    * both Clubs suits are played on one row
    * both Spades suits are played on one row

>		_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

### A player may play a continuous run
**Continuous run?**
		—starts with a viable card
		—same suit
		—same vector
		—incremental
**May?**
The player may choose to play a subset of the potential run
		—the subset set must start with the viable card
		—it may be a single card

### A player must play if they can play
**Can play?** They have a viable card

### If a player can’t play, they must say “won’t play; can’t play”

### Play continues in a clockwise fashion.

### The Winner is the first person who has no cards in their hand.

## JOKER Variations:

Jokers are added to the standard deck fo 52, making 54 per deck used.

Jokers are viable cards — they must be played if the player has no other viable cards.

Playing a Joker represents this player’s turn.
## Variation ONE:
### When a joker is played, it is placed face up in front of the player playing it.
### The player swaps one card from their own hand with one card from any other players hand
	* the player with the Joker selects both cards
## Variation TWO:
### Same as Variation ONE, except the nth joker played requires the swap of n card(s)
  * e.g. the second joker played requires two cards to be swapped
  * the player with the joker can swap each card with any player. IOW, not all cards need to be swapped with one other player, though they can be
## Variations THREE and FOUR:
### Same as Variations ONE and TWO, respectively, except the player with the Joker may chose for any swap to be between any two players.
